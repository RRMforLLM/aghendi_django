            <h1 class="hero-title">Our Story</h1>
            <p class="hero-subtitle">At Aghendi's place of origin, everything was scrambled across different ecosystems; some teachers would use classroom, whilst others opted for the school's platform of choice. Not to mention the ones that didn't even bother setting reminders or elaborating on any more information about the things that were todo in the class. Everything was a confusing cluster of scattered information.</p>
            <p class="hero-subtitle">And so, Aghendi was born with a clear mission: to provide everyone with powerful tools to organize, maintain, and share agendas that classrooms can rely on whenever they need to know what's happening.</p>

Our mission is to unify educational planning and communication in one accessible platform, making it easier for educators and students to stay synchronized and focused on what matters most: learning.</p>
